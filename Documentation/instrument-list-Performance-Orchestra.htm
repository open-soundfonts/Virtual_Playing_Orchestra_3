<h1>Performance Orchestra Notes</h1>
<ul>
	<li>Key switches are assigned to the following notes, with "n" representing where the key switches start<br />
    <br />
    Cn = Performance (default) <br />
    C#n = Tremolo (only for string section) <br />
    En  = Staccato<br />
    Fn = Pizzicato (only for strings, of course)<br />
  </li>
	<li>
    The mod wheel (cc01) controls the volume and when available, will crossfade
    between low and high velocity samples.
  </li>
  <li>
    Key velocity determines the rate of the attack of the notes as well as the
    articulation. Press gently and sustain notes will play with an attack related
    to the speed of the key press. The more quickly a note is played, the shorter
    the attack. Play a note quickly but hold it for a sudden sustain note.
    Quickly play and release a note for staccato.
  </li>
  <li>
    Although staccato can be played by playing short fast notes, it is also available
    via a key switch, and in that case playing short fast notes is not necessary. You'll
    hear staccato notes regardless of how the notes are played.
  </li>
</ul>
