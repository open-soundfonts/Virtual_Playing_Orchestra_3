Version 3.2.1.1 - Apr 24 2020
-----------------------------
* BUGS FIXED
- contrabassoon and "all-woodwinds" patches had uppercase / lowercase issues
with file paths on Linux causing a file not found error
(thanks to Aaron Walker for finding this)
- bass clarinet and bass trombone had the same uppercase / lowercase issue
(thanks to Dmitri (Dimitris).Giannos for finding this)

Version 3.2.1 - Apr 13 2020
---------------------------
* IMPROVED
- adjusted pitch of Flute SEC Sustain g5-f6
- e3 sounded like it had too much vibrato for some reason so now 3_Bb-PB-loop.wav
is used to play e3 instead of 3_Db-PB-loop.wav
- randomization of stacc and sus patches is now consistently 
this
  pitch_random=12
  amp_random=1.5 
  delay_random=0.012

instead of mostly but not always this
  pitch_random=5
  amp_random=1

* BUGS FIXED
- introduced a bug (in ver 3.1.2) where low velocity
notes in cello-SEC-PERF were no longer using a slow attack which meant
low notes would now be louder and more sudden than before. 
This has been corrected (thanks to Hix Haamankuli for discovering this)

Version 3.2 - Nov 23 2019
-------------------------
* ADDED
- bass-trombone-SOLO-PERF-KS-A5.sfz
- explicit staccato articulations for all strings, brass, woodwinds
- Key switch patches for brass, woodwinds to select the new staccato articulation
- added staccato to strings key switch patches 

* IMPROVED
- removed erroneous comment from bassoon-SEC-PERF.sfz
- reduced attack on cello SEC PERF. It was sounding a little too synthy with 
the faster attack
- adjusted tuning of cello SEC for a4-c5
- adjusted tuning of cello SEC for c4-d4
- adjusted tuning of cello SEC for f#2-g#2
- adjusted tuning of cello SEC for d#2-f2
- adjusted tuning of cello SEC for c2-d2
- adjusted tuning of flute SOLO staccato note for b4-d5
- bass trombone SOLO removed sample c#3 - due to buzz noise
- bass trombone SOLO improved sound of e3
                
* BUGS FIXED
- tubular bells are now mono
- slightly adjusted panning of FEMALE singers in the MIXED choir 

Version 3.1.2 - March 1 2019
----------------------------
* IMPROVED
- cello SEC sustain, improved a few notes by shifting which samples were
triggered by which notes
- cello SEC staccato, improved a few notes by shifting which samples were
triggered by which notes
- cello SEC, removed sample SEC 3_E-PB-loop.wav, note sounded weak when 
compared to others, stretched 3_Db-PB-loop.wav instead
- cello SOLO sustain, removed extra vibrato
- cello SOLO sustain, adjusted key mapping for a few notes to improve 
   sustained vibrato (vibrato becomes too fast if low notes stretched too high)
- now using "xf_cccurve=gain", instead of default "xf_cccurve=power" for cross
fade patches (trumpet, french horn, trombone) for smoother transition
between samples (as suggested by Zeger Knaepen)
- All sustain strings and choir, now using ampeg_vel2release for legato like
transition between slowly played string notes which means the slower the 
note is played, the longer the decay so it overlaps better with the next note.
 (as suggested by Zeger Knaepen)
- timpani - replaced artificial round robin with randomized pitch for
humanization of each hit

* BUGS FIXED
- trumpet-SEC-PERF.sfz - removed duplicate "group=1" settings as it's 
unneeded. Seems harmless but who knows.
- french-horn-SEC-PERF - removed an old comment
- timpani-hit - moved an inline comment to a line by itself. Inline
   comments have been known to cause trouble for at least one .sfz player

Version 3.1.1 - October 8 2018
------------------------------
* BUGS FIXED
- enabled Sforzando to properly handle sustain pedal such that
CC64 values 0-63 are "sustain off" as per the MIDI spec instead of just
0 being used for "sustain off".
- corrected instrument list for 1st violins, 2nd violins to warn of potential
need to transpose to reach upper notes as well as mention the C3 keyswitch option

* ADDED 
These were accidentally omitted from version 3.1
- 1st-violin-SOLO-PERF-KS-C3
- 2nd-violin-SOLO-PERF-KS-C3

Version 3.1 - June 12, 2018
---------------------------
* BUGS FIXED
- clarinet-SOLO relocated an inline comment that could cause problems for
  some sfz players
- timpani-KS-C6.sfz, there was no sound until a key switch was selected because
  the default was not set correctly in the file.
- clarinet SOLO and clarinet SEC, highest note was C7, should only be Bb6
- documentation directory was missing the .css file for the instrument lists

* IMPROVED
- 1st violin SOLO, improved blend between staccato and sustain samples.

* ADDED
- alto flute, bass clarinet, contrabassoon, bass trombone, celesta
- contrabassoon to all-woodwinds-SOLO-PERF.sfz, 
                   all-woodwinds-SOLO-PERF-panned.sfz, 
                   all-woodwinds-SEC-PERF.sfz,
                   all-woodwinds-SEC-PERF-panned.sfz

* REMOVED
These were accidentally included in version 3.0
- bass-SEC-PERF-KS-C7.sfz
- bass-SOLO-PERF-KS-C7.sfz

Version 3.0 - Feb 10, 2018
